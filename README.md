This repository contains a single WDL Workflow for syncing with Dockstore and then running on the Terra Cloud Computing Platform
After a computer glitch momentarily broke the usual method I use to upload new versions of this workflow into Terra, I decided that I would create a dedicated GitHub repo whose only purpose was to contain the most recent version of our production workflow so that it could be synced with Dockstore, etc.
